# mrhv - Magnetoresistance and hall voltage processor/plotter

</hr>

### Process and plot magnetoresistance and Hall voltage data 

The way it works:

1. opens data files for processing
2. calculates magnetoresistance peak values and ratios
3. calculates Hall voltage peak values and ratios
4. plots the angular dependence of MR and Hall voltage
5. generates a report from the calculated values
6. exports the whole thing into a .pdf file

</hr>

TODO:

- [ ] add more cool data analysis to the report, dunno
